# Sentiment_analysis
This project is about a sentimental analysis of tweets that is related to a covid19 hashtag.
We used python to clean the data and apply nlp to it.
The notebook contains all the details about the process.
We didn't get the expected results, which are the negative tweets are more than the positive ones, maybe because that we used a small data set.
